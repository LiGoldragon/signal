//! Flow-graph kinds — Node, Edge, Graph + paired Query kinds.
//!
//! Per Li 2026-04-25: *"first criome usage to be for storing
//! specification as flow-graphs (think mermaid for representing
//! flow charts, but in fully typed binary) — that way we can start
//! designing architecture in sema."*
//!
//! **Logic only, no styling.** Per Li 2026-04-25: *"the flow
//! subset is only about representing logic, not concerning itself
//! with rendering it."* No shape, edge-style, or graph-direction
//! fields — those belong to a separate rendering layer if/when we
//! ever need one.
//!
//! Each data kind has a paired `*Query` kind — `Node` ↔ `NodeQuery`,
//! `Edge` ↔ `EdgeQuery`, `Graph` ↔ `GraphQuery` — per the perfect-
//! specificity invariant ([criome/ARCHITECTURE.md §2 Invariant D
//! ](https://github.com/LiGoldragon/criome/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md#invariant-d)).
//! A query is itself a record kind, hand-written today; once
//! `prism` lands, the data and query kinds will be projected from
//! the same source records.
//!
//! **Next expected addition: node-kind taxonomy.** Today a `Node`
//! is just a name — slot identity carries the rest. The taxonomy
//! (Source / Transformer / Sink / Junction / Supervisor) lets a
//! flow-graph say what each node *does* in the dataflow, which
//! prism's first emission template needs to project a graph into
//! Rust. Lands alongside the prism skeleton; until then nodes are
//! relation-only.
